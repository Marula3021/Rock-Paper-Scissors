# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a simple fun little game I built using pure JavaScript (no UI by now), just good old logic and creativity 

One rule : first one to reach 5 points wins the game!

                                        🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me understand a bunch of core JavaScript concepts, like:

- Writing and organizing functions (getHumanChoice, getComputerChoice, playRound, playGame, playAgain)

- Using loops to repeat actions and control the game flow

- Handling user input and validation

- Using logical operators (&&, ||) to check multiple conditions

- String methods like .toLowerCase() to make the game case-insensitive

- Managing program flow with return, break, and conditionals

- Displaying results dynamically with template literals (`You win! ${humanChoice} beats ${computerChoice}`)

                                        💡 How It Works

1- You type your choice: rock, paper, or scissors

2- The computer picks one too (completely random! using Math.random())

3- The program compares both choices and declares who won

4- The first player to reach 5 points wins the game

5- When the match ends, you can choose to play again or quit

                                       🕹️ How to Play

Just open your browser console (F12 → Console tab) and run the script.
Follow the prompts, make your choice, and see if you can beat the computer! 

                                      💡 Future Ideas 💡


Rethink Rock, Paper, Scissors as a more creative and interactive version — with a story (for example, a Pokémon battle or Samurai duel).

Add a simple HTML interface with clickable buttons and CSS styling for a polished look.

Display scores and results directly on the screen instead of using the console.

Create a short story or theme (like “Pokémon Battle”, “Samurai Showdown” ....) to make the game more immersive and engaging.
